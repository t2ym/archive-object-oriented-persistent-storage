Design Goals</A>
</H1>
<P>
In this chapter, a portable design of persistent storage interface
for C++ is presented.  The requirements for a implementation of the
design are a small set of standard system calls and main memory with
linear logical address space.  The design can be used as a foundation
of an ODBMS.
<P>
Some commercial implementations of ODBMS's trap segmentation faults
to map objects from persistent storages. [<A
 HREF="node98.html#oodb">Khoshafian 93</A>] To be sure, this 
approach to persistent objects does not alter the standard interface
to object instantiations and references, but a pointer to a persistent
object is a normal C++ pointer and can not be used as a persistent
identity of the object.  In addition, it is not easy to achieve
portability by such addressing mechanism.
<P>
There are other implementations that do not trap segmentation faults
to map objects and provide unique mechanisms for object identity other
than normal pointers.  These implementations require explicit conversion
from a persistent identity of an object to a pointer to its representation
in main memory.
<P>
The design in this chapter is aiming at the latter types.  The dependency
on the architecture of the platform operating system is at the minimum
level.  The design introduces a persistent pointer object convertible to
a normal C++ pointer for manipulation of the pointed object.  The persistent
pointer also serves as the identity of the pointed object.  There should be
few restrictions on the construction of an ODBMS based on the persistent 
storage.
<P>
The design goals are summarized as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Maximum portability and flexibility must be chased.
<LI> Interfaces must be harmonious with the C++ standard interfaces.
<LI> Access to both main storage and secondary storage must be lessened.
<LI> Total storage size must be limited only by the platform operating system.
<LI> Pointer conversions should be light-weight procedures.
<LI> Operations should be extensible to concurrent and/or parallel ones.
<LI> Of course, operations must be object-oriented.
</UL>

<P><A NAME="analogy">&#160;</A>  The design goals can be depicted by an analogy of a bookshelf and a desk.
Persistent objects in secondary storage are information in closed files
on the bookshelf.  Persistent objects mapped in main memory are information 
in files on the desk.  Persistent objects the persistent pointers of which 
are converted to normal pointers are information in opened pages of the files 
on the desk.
<P>
The space on the desk is so limited that only a small part of the files
on the bookshelf can be opened simultaneously.  Nevertheless, the whole 
information on the bookshelf should be searched and modified smoothly.  
The problem is which files to bring out from the bookshelf and which files to
bring back to the bookshelf during operations.
