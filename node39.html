<P>
In the design of the persistent storage, a mapped region in main memory
can suitably be called a <B>window</B>.  Windows are exclusively used for
referencing all the objects in the persistent storage.  The analogy of
a bookshelf and a desk (See Section <A HREF="node21.html#analogy">2.1</A>) still provides a
reasonable depiction of the persistent storage.  However, the behavior of
mapped windows has some peculiarities as compared with file binders in
the analogy.
<P>
One of the peculiarities comes from synchronization, which has already
been discussed above.  The essence is the fact that digital objects are 
cloneable without modifying the original objects.
<P>
Another comes from window overlapping.  Window overlapping is an
inevitable consequence of dynamic allocation and reference of persistent
objects.  As overlapped pages of windows are mapped in the same physical
memory (See Section <A HREF="node27.html#mmapsystemcall">2.3.3</A>), any modification in one of the 
pages is instantly mirrored to all the other pages.
<P>
This quality together with unallocated regions of windows sometimes 
results in redundant windows which are removable without any loss of
information in main memory.
