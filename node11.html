<P>
The C programming language has fairly standardized I/O libraries
and storage management methods.  Objects in main memory are 
categorized into three classes by the methods of storage allocation.  
Static objects are allocated at fixed addresses and always exist
during the execution.  Auto objects are allocated at stacks at the
beginning of their scopes and destroyed at the end.  Static and auto
objects must have fixed sizes of their own.  On the other hand, dynamic 
objects are allocated at the heap areas by the storage allocator routines:
<TT>malloc()</TT> and <TT>free()</TT>.  Allocation and destruction of
dynamic objects must be explicitly controlled by the application.  
There are no other methods to access dynamic objects except pointers 
to them.
<P>
The standard I/O libraries provide the programmer with the methods
of copying objects to and from file streams.  However, pointers to
objects in main memory become meaningless once they are copied
to file streams.  This restriction imposes different representations
of linked objects in main memory and in files.  Persistence of
objects is not automatic in the C language.
